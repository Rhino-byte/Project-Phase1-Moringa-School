# Aviation Data Project
As company expands into the aviation industry, it'w worth understanding how to operate airplanes for both commercial and private purposes. However, before making any purchasing decisions, it’s critical to understand the safety risks associated with different aircraft models. My role in this project is to analyze historical aviation accident data and determine which aircraft are the safest, ensuring that the company makes informed, data-driven decisions that minimize risk and enhance operational safety.

## Objective 

The primary goal of this project is to use data from the NTSB (National Transportation Safety Board) aviation accident database to assess the safety performance of various aircraft models. By looking at accident rates, injury severity, and the types of damage aircraft experience, I'll be able to identify which models are safest and best suited for our intended operations—whether commercial or private.

## Business Understanding

1. Safety Records: I'll start by examining the overall accident rates for each aircraft model, identifying how many incidents have occurred. This will include:

* Accident Rates per Model: I'll analyze how frequently accidents or incidents are associated with each aircraft.
* Injury Severity: I’ll look at how many of these accidents involve serious or fatal injuries to get a clearer picture of safety performance.
* Aircraft Damage: By analyzing whether accidents result in minor, major, or complete destruction, I can assess which models are prone to significant damage.
2. Flight Purpose: I’ll break down the data based on the "Purpose of flight" column (e.g., personal, business, instructional), which will allow me to differentiate between aircraft used for private and commercial purposes. This will help tailor recommendations to our company’s specific operational needs, such as focusing on models that perform well in business or commercial contexts.

3. Phases of Flight: Accidents often occur during specific phases of flight (e.g., takeoff, cruise, landing), so I’ll analyze this data to see which aircraft models perform well during each phase. Understanding these patterns will help ensure that we choose aircraft that are safe for the types of operations and flight phases we expect to encounter most often.

4. Weather Conditions: The dataset includes a column for "Weather Condition" (VMC—Visual Meteorological Conditions, IMC—Instrument Meteorological Conditions), which I'll use to determine how different models perform in varying weather conditions. This will be important for assessing which aircraft can handle diverse operational environments, especially if we’re flying in areas with unpredictable weather.
